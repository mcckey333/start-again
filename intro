hello how's it going? Just trying to figure out how to work this out. I'm trying to push code from my computer to Git and all the instuctors in CodeAcademy are either shit or it's probably outdated since it hasn't been updated in 5 years. 
HAHAHA 3 hours later and we're still here. I have faith in this now, I think this is actually working now.....
